## Ralph Workflow

This project uses the **Ralph** workflow - an AI coding loop where you (Claude) work through tasks one at a time, committing after each.

### How to Determine What to Do

**Check for PRD.md first:**

1. **If PRD.md is MISSING or EMPTY:**
   → Interview the user to create it:
   - Ask what they're building (be specific)
   - Ask about tech stack preferences
   - Ask about key features and requirements
   - Break their vision into small tasks (~15-30 min each)
   - Create PRD.md with prioritized task list (use `- [ ]` checkboxes)
   - Ask if they want you to start implementing

2. **If PRD.md EXISTS with INCOMPLETE tasks (has `- [ ]` items):**
   → Follow the Ralph implementation loop:
   - Read PRD.md and progress.txt
   - Find the highest-priority incomplete task
   - Implement ONLY that single task
   - Run tests and type checks (MUST pass before committing)
   - Mark task complete in PRD.md (`- [x]`)
   - Append to progress.txt with timestamp
   - Commit with descriptive message
   - Ask if user wants to continue to next task

3. **If PRD.md is COMPLETE (all tasks are `- [x]`):**
   → Celebrate and offer next steps:
   - Congratulate the user!
   - Ask if they want to add more features
   - If yes, interview them and add new tasks to PRD.md

### Critical Rules

- **ONE TASK AT A TIME** - Never work on multiple tasks in one iteration
- **TESTS MUST PASS** - Run tests before every commit. Fix failures before committing.
- **TYPE CHECKS MUST PASS** - Run type checks (tsc, mypy, etc.) before committing
- **SMALL COMMITS** - Each commit = one completed task
- **UPDATE PROGRESS** - Always append to progress.txt with what you did and when

### Task Sizing Guide

Good tasks (~15-30 min):
- "Create login form component"
- "Add API endpoint for user creation"
- "Write tests for authentication service"

Too big (break these down):
- "Implement user authentication" → Break into: form, API, validation, session, tests
- "Build the dashboard" → Break into: layout, widgets, data fetching, etc.

### Progress Format

When updating progress.txt, use this format:
```
[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] Completed: <task description>
- <what you did>
- <any notes or decisions made>
```
